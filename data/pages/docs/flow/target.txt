====== Flow - Target (Output) ======


===== About =====
A ''target'' [[docs:resource:resource|data resource]] is:
  * the [[docs:resource:content|data]] recipient of a [[docs:op:transfer|transfer operation]]
  * or the output of a [[step|pipeline step]]


===== Transfer =====

In every [[docs:op:transfer|transfer operation]]:
  * the [[docs:resource:target_uri|target data uri]] defines the target
  * if the defined target does not exist, it will be created
  * one of the following ''target operation'' can be executed before transfer:
      * ''replace''
      * ''truncate''

<note>
The ''target operation'' in ''tabli'' is set with the ''target-operation'' [[docs:tabli:option|option]]
