====== Tabulify - Step ======


===== Step =====
A ''step'' (''operation step'') is an element of a [[docs:flow:pipeline|pipeline]] that executes a [[docs:op:op|data operation]].


===== Syntax =====

The syntax of a step is the following:
<code yaml>
pipeline:
    - name: "name" # The name of a step is the identifier and should not contains any space
      comment: "A long or short command/description of the step"
      op: "operationName" # the name of the operation to perform
      args: # The arguments to pass to the operation
          arg1:  value1 # the first argument
          arg2:  value2 # the second argument
          ....
          argN:  valueN # the Nieme argument
</code>


===== Optional Post Operation =====

A step can apply other optional [[docs:op:op|data operation]] on its [[docs:flow:source|source data resources]] after
  * successful
  * or failed execution
