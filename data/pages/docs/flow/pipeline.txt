====== Tabulify - Pipeline Flow ======

===== Pipeline =====
A ''pipeline'' defines a serie of [[docs:flow:step|step]] where:
  * the first step called the [[docs:flow:supplier|supplier step]]:
      * selects [[docs:resource:resource|data resources]]
      * and send them to the next step
  * and the following steps called [[intermediate|intermediate steps]]:
      * accept the [[target|output (target)]] of the previous step as [[source|source]]
      * and produce [[target|target (output) resources]].


===== Syntax =====
The syntax of a pipeline [[docs:common:yaml|yaml]] script is the following


<code yaml  pipeline.yml>
pipeline:
    - name: supplierStep1 # first operation of a pipeline is a supplier step
      .....
    - name: intermediateStep2 # next operation are called intermediate and works on the resource returned from the supplier
      .....
</code>
where each name is the name of a [[step|step]]

===== Execution =====
You can execute a pipeline with the [[docs:tabli:flow:execute|flow execute command]]
