====== Step Granularity ======


===== About =====
''step-granularity'' is a [[docs:tabul:option|step property]] that tells if the step is performed:
  * on each resource (default)
  * or on each record of the resource







===== Example =====
==== Resource Granularity: Table to Csv file ====
In this case, the granularity would be ''resource''.

You would get one file for one table.

==== Record Granularity: Log Column to a SQL file ====
Suppose that you have a log table that stores all SQL execution history.

It has generally one record for each execution with a column that stores the SQL executed.

If you want to export the SQL with one file by SQL, you would choose the ''record'' granularity.


===== What are the steps implementing granularity ? =====
