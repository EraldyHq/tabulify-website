====== Secret Value ======



===== About =====

''Secret'' are a piece of information that you don't want to be visible in clear in your code or to leak in any way (log, console, ...)

The most known secret are tokens that represents a credential in order to log in to a [[docs:system:system|system]]:
  * [[docs:connection:password|password]]
  * api key
  * ...
To enhance secrecy you may also want to cache other information such as the location of you system (host, port,...)

===== Ciphered Secret Format =====

We support type of ciphered secret values: 

  * operating system environment variable in the [[docs:conf:file|conf file]]. ie 
    * `${MY_SECRET}` or `$SECRET`
    * or a template string `foo${MY_SECRET}bar`
  * [[:docs:tabli:vault:encrypt|encrypted value with vault]]

If one of this value type is found, the value is considered a secret.

<note warning>
Environment variables are not considered secret by default.

If you want an environment variable to be a considered a secret, you should add it in the [[docs:conf:file|conf file]] with an environment variable value.

<code yaml>
secret: ${MY_SECRET}
