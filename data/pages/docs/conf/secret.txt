====== Secret Value ======



===== About =====

''Secret'' are a piece of information that you don't want to be visible in clear in your code or to leak in any way (log, console, ...)

The most known secret are tokens that represents a credential in order to log in to a [[docs:system:system|system]]:
  * [[docs:connection:password|password]]
  * api key
  * ...
To enhance secrecy you may also want to cache other information such as the location of you system (host, port,...)

===== Ciphered Secret Format =====

We support type of ciphered secret values: 

  * operating system environment variable in the [[docs:conf:file|conf file]]. ie 
    * `${MY_SECRET}` or `$SECRET`
    * or a template string `foo${MY_SECRET}bar`
  * [[:docs:tabli:vault:encrypt|encrypted value with vault]]

If one of this value type is found, the value is considered a secret.

===== FAQ ===== 
==== Are Environment variables considered as secret ====

[[docs:conf:os|Environment variables]] are not considered secret by default unless:

  * they have a [[:docs:tabli:vault:encrypt|encrypted value]]
  * they have in their name `secret`, `key`, `password`, `pwd`
  * they are defined in the [[docs:conf:file|conf file]] as value. Example:

<code yaml>
attribute: ${MY_SECRET}
