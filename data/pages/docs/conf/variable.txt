===== About =====
''variables'' are variables that are used to:
  * configure the behavior of tabulify
  * or as [[template|template variable]]

The same variable can be found in multiple place, we are taking the configuration with the higher priority.

A variable supports a [[docs:conf:secret|secret]] as value.

Most advanced user will edit the files manually but for convenience, we provide cli command.



By default, the file edited is:

You can:
  * add, remove variables from [[docs:conf:variable_file|variable files]] with:
      * [[docs:tabli:variable:set]]
      * [[docs:tabli:variable:delete]]
  * or list variables  with:
      * [[docs:tabli:variable:list]]

The file edited is the file given with the ''%%--vars%%'' option.
