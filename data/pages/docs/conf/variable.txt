====== Variables ======


===== About =====
''variables'' are variables that are used to:
  * configure the behavior of tabulify
  * or as [[template|template variable]] 

===== Order of Precedence =====
The same variable can be found in multiple place, we are taking the configuration with the higher priority.

Configuration Priority In Descendent Order:
  * [[:docs:tabli:option|Command line options]] (if available)
  * [[file|Configuration Vault]]
  * [[docs:conf:os|Operating System Environment variables]] with the ''TABLI_'' prefix


===== Secret =====
A variable supports any [[docs:conf:secret|ciphered secret]] as value.
===== Cli Command =====


Most advanced user will edit the [[docs:conf:file|configuration vault]] manually but for convenience, we provide the following cli commands:

  * add, remove variables with:
      * [[docs:tabli:variable:set]]
      * [[docs:tabli:variable:delete]]
  * or list variables  with:
      * [[docs:tabli:variable:list]]
