====== Variables ======


===== About =====
''attribute'' are key pair values that are used to:
  * configure the behavior of tabulify (known as parameter)
  * or as [[template|template variable]] 





===== Type =====
There is 2 kinds of attributes:
  * [[parameter|parameters]]: fixed value
  * derived: value that is:
      * computed 
      * or retrieved from a [[:docs:system:system|system]]

===== Case Independent sensitivity =====

Attribute names are ''case independent'' meaning that all these names are equivalent
  * ''UserCount / userCount'' - Camel Case
  * ''user_count / USER_COUNT'' - Snake Case
  * ''user-count / USER-COUNT'' - Kebab/Hyphen Case


Note: we detect the word parts with the letter casing (uppercasing) so the following name are not equivalent:
  * ''uSerCount'' will normalized to the parts `u`, `ser`, `count`
  * ''userCount'' will normalized to the parts `user`, `count`
