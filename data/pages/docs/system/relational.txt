===== Parameters =====


^ Name ^ Description ^ Default value ^ 
| BUILDER_CACHE_ENABLED | A builder cache | true |

The builder cache is used to cache the building of table.
Why? Because a relation object (table, views, ...) may have [[:docs:resource:dependency|dependencies]], 
building them each time, we need them has a significative impact as it's a recursive process.
