====== HTTP System ======


===== About =====
''http'' is a system of URL. 

A URL when requested returns always a [[docs:resource:content|content resource]]  (document) with a [[docs:resource:type|media type]].


===== Characteristic =====

As a [[file|file system]]:
  * a document can be seen as a file with its URL as path. 
  * ''http'' does not have the notion of directory and therefore cannot be traversed as a file tree system, therefore the [[howto:tabli:glob|glob selections]] are not available. 
  * A URL has a hierarchical structure where we can give a parent to a document.
