====== Sqlite ======


<icon name="logos:sqlite" width="280" float="right"/>
===== About =====
''Tabulify'' supports the [[https://www.sqlite.org/index.html|sqlite]] [[docs:system:relational|relational database]] as a [[docs:system:system|system]]

<note>
If you don't have any knowledge of ''Tabulify'', you can start with the [[howto:getting_started:getting_started|Learning Guide]].
</note>


===== Connection =====

See [[howto:sqlite:create]]

===== Driver =====
The driver used is the [[https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc|Xerial one]]


===== Support =====

==== Data Type ====
''Sqlite'' does not support natively the following data types.

''Tabulify'' supports them with an added layer of  functionalities and you can read on this pages how they are managed by ''Tabulify'':
  * [[time]]
  * [[boolean]]

<note>
Due to the data type affinity system of Sqlite that defined the data type by cell, it's possible to have no data type definition on a column.

If this is the case, the data type of the column is null and we infer it then to be a string (''varchar'').
</note>


==== SQLite does not support the creation and drop of constraint in the alter statement (primary, unique and foreign key) ====

Unfortunately, SQLite does not support the creation and dropping of constraints [[https://www.sqlite.org/lang_altertable.html|as we can see in the alter table statement]].

You can't drop any primary key, unique key and foreign keys.

You need to:
  * [[:howto:sql_schema:create_table_with_dependencies|create a new schema]]
  * and to copy or move the data

We still support the constraint creation with the `CREATE TABLE` statement.
