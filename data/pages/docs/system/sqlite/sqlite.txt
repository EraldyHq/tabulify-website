</note>


===== Connection =====

To create a ''Sqlite'' connection, you have the following possibilities
<tabs enclosed-tabs>
<panel>
<label>Connection Vault</label>
In a [[docs:conf:file|Connection Vault]], to define a sqlite [[docs:connection:connection|connection]] with the name ''mySqlite'', you would write:
\\
  * On Linux
<code properties>
[mySqlite]
url = jdbc\:sqlite\:////home/leo/work/mydatabase.db
driver = org.sqlite.JDBC
</code>
   * On Windows
<code properties>
[mySqlite]
url = jdbc\:sqlite\:///C\:/Users/user/AppData/Local/tabulify/sqlite.db
driver = org.sqlite.JDBC
</code>

</panel>
<panel selected>
<label>Tabli</label>

With the [[docs:tabli:connection:add|tabli add command of the connection module]], adding a Sqlite connection with the name ''sqliteConnectionName'':


  * On Windows
<code dos>
tabli connection add "sqliteConnectionName" "jdbc:sqlite:C:/work/mydatabase.db"
</code>
  * On Linux
<code dos>
tabli connection add "sqliteConnectionName" "jdbc:sqlite:/home/leo/work/mydatabase.db"
</code>

</panel>
</tabs>
===== Data Type =====
''Sqlite'' does not support natively the following data types.

''Tabulify'' supports them with an added layer of  functionalities and you can read on this pages how they are managed by ''Tabulify'':
  * [[time]]
  * [[boolean]]

<note>
Due to the data type affinity system of Sqlite that defined the data type by cell, it's possible to have no data type definition on a column.

If this is the case, the data type of the column is null and we infer it then to be a string (''varchar'').
</note>

===== Driver =====
The driver used is the [[https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc|Xerial one]]
