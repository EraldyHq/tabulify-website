===== Connection =====

[[howto:oracle:create_connection|]]
===== Version =====

The [[https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/jdbc-downloads.html|driver version]] used is the ''23.7.0.25.01''


===== Parameters =====

==== Quoted identifier is disabled by default ====

We disable quoted identifier by setting by default the [[:docs:system:relational#NAME_QUOTING_ENABLED|NAME_QUOTING_ENABLED]] parameter to false for Oracle.

Why ? 
  * Because it requires you to put always the quotation mark even in a `SQL SELECT` which is crazy. 
  * You can't write `select cat_id`, you need to write `select "cat_id"`
  * Why it requires it? The quotes are part of the `name` and are not an escape feature, meaning that when you get the table name, you don't get `cat_id`, you get `"cat_id"`

<blockquote>
If you name a schema object using a quoted identifier, then you must use the double quotation marks whenever you refer to that object.
<cite>[[https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/sqlrf/Database-Object-Names-and-Qualifiers.html|Oracle Ref]]</cite>
</blockquote>

===== Type =====

==== Integer ====

The `SQL Integer` type does not exist in Oracle. 
We create them with 
```sql
NUMERIC(p)
```
and we infer them when the scale of a `Oracle NUMERIC` type is empty.
