====== Oracle Database ======



===== About =====
''Tabulify'' supports the [[https://www.oracle.com/database/|Oracle]] [[docs:system:relational|relational database]] as a [[docs:system:system|system]]

<note>
If you don't have any knowledge of ''Tabulify'', you can start with the [[howto:getting_started:getting_started|Learning Guide]],
otherwise you can also browser the [[howto:sqlite:sqlite|relational database Howto's]]
</note>


===== Connection =====

To create a ''Oracle'' connection, you have the following possibilities
<tabs skin="tabs">
<tab panel="connectionVault" >Connection Vault</tab>
<tab panel="tabli" selected="true">Tabli</tab>
</tabs>
<tabpanels>
<tabpanel id="connectionVault" spacing="m-3">
In a [[docs:conf:vault|Connection Vault]], to define a Oracle [[docs:connection:connection|connection]] with the name ''myOracle'', you would write:
\\

<code properties>
[myOracle]
url = jdbc\:oracle\:thin\:@[host]\:[port]/[servicename]
driver = oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver
user = loginUser
password = loginPassword
</code>
<note>
The [[docs:connection:password|password]] will be [[docs:common:vault|encrypted]] the next time that you start a Tabulify product such as [[docs:tabli:tabli|Tabli]]
</note>
</tabpanel>
<tabpanel id="tabli" spacing="m-3">

With the [[docs:tabli:connection:add|tabli add command of the connection module]], adding a Oracle connection with the name ''oracleConnectionName'':

<unit display="none">
<code bash>
tabli connection delete --not-strict "oracleConnectionName"
</code>
</unit>


  * With the Windows CMD console
<code bash>
tabli connection add "oracleConnectionName" "jdbc:oracle:thin:@[host]:[port]/[servicename]" ^
    --user login ^
    --password password
</code>
  * With Linux Bash
<code bash>
tabli connection add "oracleConnectionName" "jdbc:oracle:thin:@[host]:[port]/[servicename]" \
    --user login \
    --password password
</code>

</tabpanel>
</tabpanels>

===== Version =====

The [[https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/jdbc-downloads.html|driver version]] used is the ''23.7.0.25.01''


===== Parameters =====

==== Quoted identifier is disabled by default ====

We disable quoted identifier by setting by default the [[:docs:system:relational#NAME_QUOTING_ENABLED|NAME_QUOTING_ENABLED]] parameter to false for Oracle.

Why ? 
  * Because it requires you to put always the quotation mark even in a `SQL SELECT` which is crazy. 
  * You can't write `select cat_id`, you need to write `select "cat_id"`
  * Why it requires it? The quotes are part of the `name` and are not an escape feature, meaning that when you get the table name, you don't get `cat_id`, you get `"cat_id"`

<blockquote>
If you name a schema object using a quoted identifier, then you must use the double quotation marks whenever you refer to that object.
<cite>[[https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/sqlrf/Database-Object-Names-and-Qualifiers.html|Oracle Ref]]</cite>
</blockquote>

===== Type =====

==== Integer ====

The `SQL Integer` type does not exist in Oracle. 
We create them with 
```sql
NUMERIC(p)
```
and we infer them when the scale of a `Oracle NUMERIC` type is empty.
