====== MySql ======


===== About =====
<icon name="logos:mysql" /> ''MySql'' is a [[docs:system:relational|relational database system]] that is supported as [[docs:flow:source|source]] and [[docs:flow:target|target]].




===== Howto =====
To follow the [[howto:howto|Howto]], you need to start a MySql container database. 

The steps by steps are available on this page: [[howto:mysql:howto_connection]]

===== Creation =====

See [[:howto:mysql:create_connection|]]
===== Support =====


==== Catalog vs Database vs Schema ====
In ''MySQL'' (([[https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-table.html#create-table-name|Reference Fully Qualified Table Name]])) :
  * ''SQL Catalog'' are called  ''database''
  * ''SQL Schema'' are not supported

Because Tabulify is data source agnostic, a ''MySql Catalog'' is known as a [[docs:resource:schema|schema]] (ie the first parent).

To known about the historic of it, check this [[https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-odbc/en/connector-odbc-usagenotes-functionality-catalog-schema.html|article]]

==== Upsert ====

MySql does not support the statement `insert on conflict`. 

We have implemented for the [[:docs:op:upsert|upsert operation]] the [[https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/insert-on-duplicate.html|on duplicate key update]] statement.

Example:
```sql
insert into `howto`.`d_category` (`cat_id`, `cat_desc`, `load_timestamp`)
values (1, 'desc', '2020-11-17 13:20:38.5')
on duplicate key update `load_timestamp` = values(`load_timestamp`)
```


==== Text Data Type ====
See [[docs:system:mysql:text|]]

==== TimeZone ====


Timezone data type does exist as MySQL [[https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/datetime.html|converts TIMESTAMP values from the current time zone to UTC for storage, and back from UTC to the current time zone for retrieval]].

We transform then automatically:
  * ''timestamp with timezone'' to ''timestamp'' utc
  * ''time with timezone'' to ''time'' utc 
==== Version ====
MySql is tested against version [[https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/|5.7]].
