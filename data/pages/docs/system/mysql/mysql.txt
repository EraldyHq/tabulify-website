====== MySql ======


===== About =====
''MySql'' is a [[docs:system:relational|relational database system]] that is supported as [[docs:flow:source|source]] and [[docs:flow:target|target]].

===== Catalog vs Database vs Schema =====
In ''MySQL'' (([[https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-table.html#create-table-name|Reference Fully Qualified Table Name]])) :
  * ''SQL Catalog'' are called  ''database''
  * ''SQL Schema'' are not supported

Because Tabulify is data source agnostic, a ''MySql Catalog'' is known as a [[docs:resource:schema|schema]] (ie the first parent).

MySql is tested against version [[https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/|5.7]].
