====== Tabulify - Project ======


===== Project =====
A ''project'' is a directory where the [[docs:conf:file|configuration vault]] is located.

When present, the [[:docs:connection:connection#default|default connection]] is the [[:docs:connection:project|project connection (ie project home)]]

It groups the following artifactories:
  * [[docs:resource:resource]] ([[docs:resource:file|file]], [[docs:resource:script]], ...)
  * [[docs:flow:pipeline]] - data processing pipeline



Typically ''Tabulify'' projects are stored in a version control system such as Git and are hooked to a Continuous Integration system that deploy to target environement such as production or test.
