====== Data Operation - Copy ======


===== About =====
''copy'' is [[transfer|transfer]] ''data operation'' that will create a ''copy'' of the original [[docs:resource:resource|data resource]] meaning:
  * with the same [[docs:resource:metadata|metadata (properties and structure)]]
  * and with the same [[docs:resource:content|data content]].

A [[diff|diff]] operation would show no difference.




===== Prerequisites =====

If the target exists, the target should:
    * have the same [[docs:resource:metadata|metadata (properties and structure)]]
    * be empty

===== Cli =====
The [[docs:tabul:data:copy|tabul data copy command]] implements the ''copy'' operation.
