====== Data Operation - Query ======


===== About =====
''query'' is an [[op|data operation]] that sends a [[docs:resource:query|query]] to a [[docs:connection:connection|connection]] and retrieves a [[docs:resource:resource|data resource]].



<note tip>
By executing a lot of query with the [[docs:tabli:data:query|query command]], you can send a [[docs:benchmark|benchmark workload]] to your [[docs:connection:connection|connection]] and collect performance metrics.
