====== Concat ======


===== About =====

''Concat'' is a [[docs:op:op|data operation]] that will concatenate multiple data resources into one.



It's an alias of the [[docs:op:transfer|transfer operation]] where:
  * the method is set to ''insert''
  * the target name stays the same for all sources (ie the [[:docs:resource:target_data_uri|target data uri]] does not have a [[:docs:resource:target_pattern|target pattern]])
