====== Concat ======


===== About =====

''Concat'' is an [[docs:op:op|data operation]] that will concatenate multiple data resources into one.


===== Concat vs Transfer =====

You can also concatenate with the [[docs:op:transfer|transfer operation]]. 

The [[docs:op:transfer|transfer operation]] will concatenate when:
  * the method is ''insert''
  * the target name stays the same (ie is not a [[:docs:resource:target_pattern|target pattern]])

The ''concat'' operation is an in-memory operation, if you want to concatenate large files, you should use the [[docs:op:transfer|transfer operation]].
