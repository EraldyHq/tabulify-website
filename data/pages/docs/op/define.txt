====== Data Operation - Define ======


===== Define =====
''define'' is a [[:docs:flow:supplier|supplier]] [[op|operation]] that defines one or more inline [[docs:resource:resource|data resources]]
in a [[docs:flow:pipeline|pipeline file]].


Note that a [[select|select operation]] may not return any [[docs:resource:resource|data resources]] but the ''define'' operation must return always the data resource that it defines.


This is a first step (known as the [[docs:flow:supplier|supplier step]]) because it supplies [[docs:resource:resource|data resources]] to the others operations in the pipeline.

===== Example =====

  * [[howto:pipeline:define]]

===== Arguments =====
The ''define'' operations accept the following arguments.

^ Arguments ^ Mandatory ^ Definition ^
| ''data-uri'' | only if ''data'' is not defined | The [[docs:resource:data_uri|data uri]] is the location of the resource |
| ''data'' | only if ''data-uri'' is not defined | The ''data'' as a list of [[docs:resource:record|records]] (the data are in the inline) |
| ''data-attributes'' | no | The data attributes in a [[docs:resource:data-definition|data definition format]] |
| ''data-resources'' | | to define more than one data resource (a list of inline data resources) |
