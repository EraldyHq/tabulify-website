====== Data Operation - Rename ======


===== About =====
''rename'' is a [[op|data operation]] that will juste update the [[docs:resource:path|path attribute]]. This is a [[docs:resource:metadata|metadata operation]] and therefore does not move any [[docs:resource:content|data]] and is really quick.


===== Optimization =====

As a rename is :
  * a [[docs:op:move|move]] (ie [[docs:op:copy|copy]] with source drop)
  * on the same [[:docs:connection:connection|connection]]
when this kind of transfer is detected, ''Tabulify'' will just performs a ''rename''.
