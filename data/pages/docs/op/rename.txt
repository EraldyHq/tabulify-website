====== Data Operation - Rename ======


===== About =====
''rename'' is a [[op|data operation]] that will juste update the [[docs:resource:path|path attribute]]. This is a [[docs:resource:metadata|metadata operation]] and therefore does not move any [[docs:resource:content|data]] and is really quick.

<note>
If a [[transfer|transfer operation]] [[move|moves]] a [[docs:resource:resource|data resource]] on the same [[docs:connection:connection|connection]], ''Tabulify'' will just performs a ''rename''.
</note>
