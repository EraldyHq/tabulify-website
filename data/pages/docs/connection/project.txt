====== Connection - Project (Home Directory) ======


===== Home =====
''project'' is a [[built-in|built-in connection]] that points to the [[docs:project:project|project]] directory.

It is automatically created when:
  * a [[docs:project:project-file|project file]] is detected
  * the ''%%--project-home%%'' is passed as an [[docs:tabli:option|option]]
  * or the ''%%TABLI_PROJECT_HOME%%'' [[:docs:conf:os|OS environment variable]] is set

===== Example =====

By setting the [[docs:tabli:global|global option]] ''%%--project-home%%'', we are defining a [[docs:project:project|project run]] in the ''tabli-project'' directory from the [[docs:connection:home|user home directory (@user)]]. We can therefore see its [[attribute|attributes]] with the [[docs:tabli:connection:info|info command]].
