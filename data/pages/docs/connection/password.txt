====== Connection - Password Attribute ======


===== Password =====
A ''password'' is a [[attribute|connection attribute]] that permits to identify the user. 


===== How to set it? =====

If you want to set the connection password for the connection name ''postgres'', you can
set it on Linux as [[:docs:conf:os|environment variable]]:

<code bash>
export TABLI_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=xxx
# ie export TABLI_connectionNAME_PASSWORD=xxx
</code>

You can even [[:docs:tabli:vault:encrypt|encrypt the value]].

To be more explicit or if you want to use another name, you can set it in the [[:docs:conf:vault|configuration vault file]]:

<code yaml>
connections:
  postgres:
     password: ${YOUR_PASSWORD}
</code>
