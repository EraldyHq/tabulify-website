====== Connection - URI attribute ======


===== URL =====
''URI'' is a mandatory [[attribute|attribute]] of a [[connection|connection]] and is also known as the ''connection string''

It's a string that defines the most important connection properties such as:
  * the ''scheme'': the technology used to connect
  * the ''host'': the host where the system is located
  * the ''port'': the port where the system is reachable on the host
  * the ''database'': the database name

The ''URI'' is system dependent and therefore should be looked in the [[docs:system:system|documentation page of each system]].

This is the property that defines the connection to a [[docs:system:system|system]]

<note tip>
The ''URI'' is also known as:
  * [[wp>Data_source_name|Data Source Name (DSN)]]
  * or ''connection string''
</note>
===== Example =====

Example of URI with with the [[docs:tabli:connection:list|tabli connection list]] command where you can see the [[howtos|howtos]] connection.
