====== Histogram Generator ======


===== About =====
A ''histogram generator'' is a [[column|column data generator]] that [[generator|generates]] a ''value'' according to its ''chance factor''.


<note>
This generator is used to generate data that follows a [[howto:generator:histogram_normal_distribution|probability distribution]] where the factor is the probability for the value.

===== Properties =====

==== Buckets ====
This generator has only one property that defines the ''histogram'' namely, the ''buckets''.

A ''bucket'' is a ''value'' and its ''chance factor''

Example if you want to simulate that people may work the week-end once every 10 weeks, you will define this bucket list
<code yaml>
buckets:
   Monday: 10
   Tuesday: 10
   Wednesday: 10
   Thursday: 10
   Friday: 10
   Saturday: 1
   Sunday: 1
</code>
