====== Histogram Generator ======


===== About =====
A ''histogram generator'' is a [[column|column data generator]] that [[generator|generates]] a ''value'' according to its ''chance factor''.


<note>
This generator is used to generate data that follows a [[howto:generator:histogram_normal_distribution|probability distribution]] where the factor is the probability for the value.
</note>


===== Example =====

==== Distribution over week day (Varchar) ====

Example if you want to simulate that people may work the week-end once every 10 weeks, you will define this bucket list
<code yaml>
Columns:
  - name: bucket_map
    type: varchar
    DataGenerator:
      type: histogram
      Buckets:
        Monday: 10
        Tuesday: 10
        Wednesday: 10
        Thursday: 10
        Friday: 10
        Saturday: 1
        Sunday: 1
</code>

==== Normal Distribution over Arrival Time ====

Example of normal distribution over time
<unit>
<file yaml histogram_normal_distribution--datagen.yml>
MaxRecordCount: 30
Columns:
  - name: id
    type: integer
    comment: A id column to see easily the number of values generated
    DataGenerator:
      type: sequence
  - name: bucket_map
    type: time
    comment: A column with a histogram generator that generates an uniform distribution of time
    DataGenerator:
      type: histogram
      Buckets:
        "8:45": 0.05
        "8:50": 0.5
        "8:55": 0.22
        "9:00": 0.4
        "9:05": 0.22
        "9:10": 0.5
        "9:15": 0.05

</file>
</unit>
===== Properties =====

==== Buckets ====
This generator has only one property that defines the ''histogram'' namely, the ''buckets''.

A ''bucket'' is a ''value'' and its ''chance factor''


===== Data Type =====

The below data type are supported:

^ Name ^ Yaml Format ^ Example ^ 
| Integer | `d` | `8` |
| Double | `d.dd` | `8.00` |
| [[:docs:common:time|Date]] | `YYYY-MM-DD` | `1970-01-01` |
| [[:docs:common:time|Timestamp]] | `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` | `1970-01-01 00:00:00`|
| [[:docs:common:time|Time]] | `"HH:MM"`, `"HH:MM:SS"`, `"HH:MM:SS.SSS"` | `"08:00"` <inote warning>quote is mandatory</inote> |
| Varchar | `".*"` | `"a text"` |

Why the time must be quoted? Yaml does not [[https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/|support time as a type]]. The time string should be quoted.


===== How to define a Bucket definition in a data set =====

Note that the [[docs:generator:data-set|data set]] and the [[entity|entity]] generator creates histogram from [[:docs:resource:resource|resources]].

  * The data being defined by the ''column'' attribute
  * the chance factor being defined by the `probability`, `weight` or `factor` column
