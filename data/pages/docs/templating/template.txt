====== Tabulify - template ======


===== Template =====
A template is a [[docs:resource:text|text document]] that contains ''variable name'' (with optionally processing logic syntax). 

Each [[engine|engine]] supports its own template syntax.


===== Operation =====
To transform a template into a [[docs:resource:resource|data resource]], you use the [[docs:op:template|template operation]].

===== Type =====

A template may be from the following [[docs:resource:type|type]]:
  * [[docs:resource:text|text]] (default)
  * [[docs:resource:xml|xml]]
  * [[docs:resource:json|json]]
  * ''html''
  * ''javascript''
  * ''css''
  * ''raw'' - the template will not be processed and be returned as-is. (no-op operation)


They are not all supported by the [[engine|template engine]] and you should verify in the [[engine|engine documentation]].
