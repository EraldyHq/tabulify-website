====== Tabulify - Boolean Data Type ======

===== Boolean =====
This page contains the documentation about how ''Tabulify'' is managing the ''Boolean'' [[data_type|data type]].


===== Storage =====

By default, ''Tabulify'' stores ''boolean'' data natively in the target system as ''boolean'' object. 

For [[docs:system:system|system]], that does not support the ''boolean'' as data type, ''Tabulify'' may save them as binary integer (ie 0 or 1)

This behavior is controllable with the  ''tabBooleanDataType'' [[docs:connection:built_in_variables|tabulify connection attribute]]

^ Possible Values ^ Description ^
| ''Native'' (Default) | Save the boolean in the data type of the system |
| ''Binary'' | Integer (0 or 1) |


===== Conversion ======
''Tabulify'' extends the boolean system and recognize natively the following string and number as ''BOOLEAN'' (case indépendant: ''Y'' or ''y'' means ''y'') when transferring data from a system to another.

^ Object (case indépendant) ^ Boolean Value ^
|true|1|
|1|1|
|t|1|
|yes|1|
|y|1|
|on|1|
|false|0|
|0|0|
|no|0|
|f|0|
|n|0|
|off|0|
|Empty String|NULL|
|na|NULL|
|null|NULL|
