====== Execution environment ======


===== About =====
An ''environment'' is a string that permits to see if the execution occurs in production or not.

===== Built-in =====

Tabulify knows the following environments:

^ Name ^ default ^ Description ^
| ''prod'' |  | The production  environment |
| ''dev'' | x | The dev environment |



<note>
[[:docs:op:op|operations]] may react differently depending on it.

To avoid sending emails in a non-production environment, the [[docs:op:sendmail|send operation]] will send them all
to the ''to'' address of the smtp connection.
</note>

===== How to set the environment ? =====

You can set the environment :
  * at the command line with the ''--env'' option of tabli.
<code bash>
tabli --env dev
</code>
  * via a [[docs:conf:os|tabli os environment variable]]
<code bash>
export TABLI_ENV=dev
</code>

===== How to see the environment =====

With the ''env'' internal variable.

Example:
<code bash>
tabli variable list env
</code>
