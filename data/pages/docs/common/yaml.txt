====== Yaml ======

===== About =====
Tabulify uses Yaml as the file format of
  * [[..:conf:vault|configuration vault]]
  * and [[docs:flow:pipeline|pipeline]].



===== Timestamp Variation =====
''Tabulify'' introduces one variation of the ''YAML'' specification in the manipulation of [[#Timestamp|Timestamp]].

In the [[https://yaml.org/type/timestamp.html|Yaml specification, a timestamp]] without timezone is interpreted as having the ''UTC'' timezone. ''Tabulify'' changes this behavior and delete the time zone information.

Why ? Because if you are specifying the timestamp ''2020-10-01 01:00:00'' in YAML and that you are in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%2B02:00UTC+2|UTC+2 timezone (Amsterdam)]], you will see the time  ''2020-10-01 02:00:00'' and that's too much trouble to understand why.


Example:
  * timestamp without timezone
<code yaml>
timestamp: 2020-10-01 01:00:00
</code>
  * timestamp with the timezone [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%2B02:00UTC+2|UTC+2 time (Amsterdam)]]
<code yaml>
timestamp: 2020-10-01 01:00:00 +2
</code>

More on the timestamp in ''Yaml'' format can be found on [[https://yaml.org/type/timestamp.html|this page]].
