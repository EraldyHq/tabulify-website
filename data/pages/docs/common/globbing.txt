====== Tabulify - Glob Pattern ======


===== Glob Pattern =====
<icon name="carbon:character-patterns"/> ''Glob pattern'' are used in ''Tabulify'' to select objects such as :
  * [[docs:connection:connection|connection]]
  * [[docs:resource:resource|resource]] (in [[docs:resource:data_selector|data selector]])
  * or [[..:conf:conf|configuration]]


<note info>
If you are new to ''glob pattern'', see this page [[howto:tabul:glob]]
</note>


===== Wildcard support =====

The following wildcard are supported in order to define the glob pattern:
  * ''*'' that matches every characters
  * ''%%**%%'' matches all [[docs:resource:container|container (directories/schema)]]. Use for recursive search (for instance ''**/foo.md'' will search all ''foo.md'' files in all sub directories)
  * ''?'' that matches a single character
  * ''[]'' that matches a class of character (Example: ''[0-9]'' matches all digit)
  * ''[!]'' that does not match a character in the class of character. (Example: ''[!0-9]'' will not match a digit)
  * ''{pattern1,pattern2,..}'' to match a collection of sub-pattern (Example: ''{temp*,tmp*}'' matches all data resource name that begins with ''temp'' or ''tmp''). It creates also a group for back-referencing.

===== Back-referencing =====

When data resources are selected via globbing, they get extra numeric variables that captures the text that matches.

ie:
  * the variable ''1'' is the text captured by the first glob pattern
  * the variable ''2'' is the text captured by the second glob pattern
  * and so on.

You can use this extra variable in:
  * a [[docs:conf:template|template name]]
  * a [[docs:resource:target_data_uri|target uri]]

Example with the [[:docs:tabul:data:list|data list command]] that:
  * selects the table that starts with ''web'' on a [[:docs:system:tpcds|tpcds schema]]
  * shows the [[docs:resource:logical_name|logical]] and the ''1'' first back-reference value

<unit>
<code bash>
tabul data list -a logicalName -a 1 web_*@tpcds
</code>
<console>
logicalName   1
-----------   -------
web_page      page
web_returns   returns
web_sales     sales
web_site      site
</console>
</unit>
