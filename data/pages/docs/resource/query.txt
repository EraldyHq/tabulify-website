====== Resource - Query (Runtime Data Resource) ======

===== Query =====

A ''query'' is a [[script|script]] that returns a [[docs:resource:content|content resource]].

That's why we called them also ''runtime'' [[resource|data resource]] because the [[docs:resource:content|content]] is created when the ''query'' is running.

''Tabulify'' supports actually two queries:
  * the [[docs:resource:select|Sql query]].
  * and the HTTP get query.



===== Selectors =====
A ''query selector'' is a [[script_selector|script selector]] where the first part is itself a [[data_selector|data selector]]

<code>
(globPattern@QueryConnection)@targetConnection
</code>
where:
    * ''(globPattern@QueryConnection)'' is the [[data_selector|data selector]] that locates the ''query''
    * and ''@targetConnection'' defines the [[docs:connection:connection|connection]] where the query will be executed.
