====== Data Resource - HTML ======



===== About =====
The ''html'' files are supported. Tabulify will extract by default the first ''html'' table (ie [[tabular_file|tabular file]] [[resource|data resource]]).

<note>
If you want the whole content, you can set the [[docs:resource:type|resource type]] to ''text''.
</note>

If there is no table element in the html page, the created resource has one cell with the whole content.
===== Example =====

[[:howto:html:html|]]
===== Attributes =====

The [[docs:resource:attribute|data attributes]]  for an HTML file are:

^ Name ^ Default Value ^ Description ^
| ''TABLE_SELECTOR'' | ''%%table%%'' | The Css selector to obtain the table element |
| ''HEADER_SELECTOR'' | ''%%th%%'' | The Css selector to obtain the headers elements in the table |
| ''ROW_SELECTOR'' | ''tr'' | The Css selector to obtain the rows in the table |
| ''DATA_SELECTOR'' | ''th, td'' | The Css selector to obtain the data cell in the row |

<note tip>
Because a ''html'' file is also a [[text|text file]], you can also set [[text#properties|text properties]] such as the character set.
