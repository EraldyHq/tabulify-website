====== Data Resource - HTML ======



===== About =====
The ''html'' file are supported. Tabulify will extract by default the first ''html'' table (ie [[tabular_file|tabular file]] [[resource|data resource]]).

<note>
If you want the whole content, you can set the [[docs:resource:type|resource type]] to ''text''.
</note>


===== Properties =====


^ Name ^ Default Value ^ Description ^
| ''tableSelector'' | ''%%table%%'' | The Css selector to obtain the table element |
| ''headerSelector'' | ''%%th%%'' | The Css selector to obtain the headers elements |
| ''rowSelector'' | ''tr'' | The Css selector to obtain the rows |
| ''dataSelector'' | ''th, td'' | The Css selector to obtain the data cell |

<note tip>
Because a ''html'' file is also a [[text|text file]], you can also set [[text#properties|text properties]] such as the character set.
</note>

If there is no table element in the html page, the created resource has one cell with the whole content.
