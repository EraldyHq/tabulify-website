====== Data Resource - Record (Row)======


===== Record =====
A ''record'' (or ''row'') is the element unit of a [[docs:resource:tabular|tabular data resource]] (ie a [[docs:resource:tabular|tabular data resource]] is composed of one or more records).


<note>
If the data resource is a [[docs:resource:content|content resource]], the [[count|count attribute]] gives back the number of record that a data resource contains.
