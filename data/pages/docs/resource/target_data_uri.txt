====== Data Resource - Target Data URI ======

===== About =====
A ''target data uri'' is a [[:docs:resource:data_uri|data uri]] that defines one or more [[docs:flow:target|target resources]] via template pattern for operation with targets such as 
  * [[docs:op:transfer|transfer operations]]
  * [[:docs:op:diff|diff operation]]


===== Example =====
==== Reusing the name of the source in the target ====

The below target data uri
<code>
new_$name@sqlite
</code>
will define the ''target resource''
  * located in the sqlite connection
  * and a name that is composed of
    * the prefix ''new_''
    * and the [[docs:resource:name|name of the data source]] (''$name'')

Example: if the source table name is ''time'', the target table name would be ''new_time''

==== Using a part of source name in the target ====

With a [[docs:common:globbing|glob pattern]], you can reference parts of the source.

Example with the below [[data_selector|data selector]]
<code>
D?*@sqlite
</code>
and the below target data uri
<code bash>
# 2 for the second glob pattern (ie for the *), 1 being for the first ?
$2@sqlite
</code>
  * if the source table name were ''D_TIME'', ''D_CUSTOMERS'',
  * the target table names would be ''TIME'', ''CUSTOMERS''

==== File system ====

In a [[docs:common:shell|shell]] such as powershell, the ''$'' character should be quoted.

<code powershell>
tabul data copy '*/bootstrap.min.css@cd' '/boot/bootstrap.$1.min.css@cd'
</code>


===== Syntax =====


<code bash>
pattern[@connection]
</code>
where:
  * ''connection'' is the [[docs:connection:name|name of a connection]]
  * ''pattern'' is an [[target_pattern|target pattern]] (an expression that define the name of the target).
