====== Data Resource - Tabular File ======

===== About =====
A ''tabular file'' is a [[docs:resource:file|file]] that may show a [[docs:resource:tabular|tabular structure]].
===== List =====

By default, Tabulify considers all files as tabular.
  * For instance, a [[docs:resource:text|text file]] is by default seen as one column table filled with lines

Below are a list of files that have a natural tabular format:
  * [[docs:resource:csv]]
  * [[docs:resource:excel]]
  * [[json]] when the chosen structure option is ''tabular''
