Tabli data query
================

The query command allows performance test.

This command will execute one or multiple queries, fetch the data (ie get the data locally) and returns the performance metrics

A query is an executable statement that returns data.
In Sql, if the statement is a `select` statement it will be executed, otherwise the query will be created for a table or a view.
This means that you can also use this command to measure the fetch of data on your network.


Note: If you want to:
  * show the data result of a query execution, the `print`, `head`, `tail` command is recommended
  * transfer/load the result of a query, you should use the `transfer` command
  * shows the structure of a query, you should use the `struct` command



Examples
--------

 1 - Execute all the queries written in the sql files that begins with `dim` in the current directory (ie `local` connection)


        tabli data query (dim*.sql@local)@sqlite


 2 - Execute the query written in the file `Query1.sql` against the `sqlite` connection and execute the query written in the file `Query2.sql` against the `oracle` connection 


        tabli data query (Query1.sql)@sqlite (Query2.sql)@oracle


 3 - Execute all sql files present in the local directory `project/withQueries` against the `postgres` data store and store the result in the `perf` table.


        tabli data query --output-data-uri perf@postgres (project/withQueries/*.sql)@postgres
