====== Learning Tabulify - Step 3 - What's a Connection ? ======


===== Connection =====
In the [[2_data_resource|previous page]], we learned that all ''data'' are known as [[docs:resource:resource|data resource]].

[[docs:resource:resource|Data resources]] are stored in  ''systems'' in ''Tabulify''.


There is generally speaking two kind of [[docs:system:system|systems]]:
  * [[docs:system:file|file system]]
  * [[docs:system:database|database]] (Postgres, Oracle, MySql, ...)

A ''Connection'' is a set of properties that defines how to connect to this systems.


===== List =====

''Tabulify'' comes with:
  * [[docs:connection:built-in|built-in connection]] (connection that are always available)
  * and [[docs:connection:howtos|howto connection]] (connections used in the [[howto:howto|howto pages]])

The default connection is the ''current directory'' of the local file system, known as the [[docs:connection:cd|cd]] (for short).


In this ''learning guide'', we used mostly:
  * [[docs:connection:cd|cd]]: the local file system
  * [[docs:connection:tpcds|tpcds]]: a set of table and their data for benchmarking purpose.
  * and the [[docs:connection:howtos|sqlite howto local database]]


You can see the full list with the [[docs:tabli:connection:list|connection list]] command.
