====== Tabulify - How to generate a sequence based on provided values ======

===== About =====
This [[..:howto|how-to]] shows you how to generate a <icon name="ant-design:ordered-list-outlined" /> [[docs:generator:sequence|sequence]] based on provided values with the [[docs:generator:sequence|column sequence generator]].

This page demonstrate the ''values'' and ''reset'' property of the [[docs:generator:sequence|column sequence generator]].

The sequence will be created with a list of colors.

===== Steps =====

==== Creation of the generator file ====
To generate data, you need to create a [[docs:resource:generator|generator file]] that will describe the data to be generated.

The below [[docs:resource:generator|data resource generator]]:
  * has the [[docs:resource:name|name]] ''sequence_color--datagen.yml''
  * has the [[docs:resource:logicalname|logical name]] ''sequence_color''
  * will generate ''10'' values (''MaxRecordCount'' count)
  * has a column named ''id'' that has [[docs:generator:sequence|sequence data generator]] that:
      * starts by default at the value ''1''
      * increments by default with the value ''1''
  * has a column named ''seq_color'' with the ''varchar'' data type (default) that has [[docs:generator:sequence|sequence data generator]] that:
      * will reset (restart from the first value when the last is reached)
      * will return the color values provided in the ''values'' property.

<unit>
<file yaml sequence_color--datagen.yml>
MaxRecordCount: 10
Columns:
  - name: id
    type: integer
    comment: A id column to see easily the number of values generated
    DataGenerator:
      type: sequence
  - name: seq_color
    type: varchar
    comment: A column with a color sequence date generator
    DataGenerator:
      type: sequence
      # when the last color has been given (black), restart from the first element (blue)
      reset: true
      # the list of values returned in sequence
      values:
        - blue
        - red
        - green
        - cyan
        - magenta
        - yellow
        - black



</file>
</unit>
==== Printing the data ====

With the [[docs:tabli:data:print|data print command]], we can print the ''values'' generated.
<unit>
<code bash>
tabli data print sequence_color--datagen.yml@howto
</code>
<note tip>
[[docs:connection:howto|howto]] is the connection that contains the files used in the [[..:howto|HowTo's]].
</note>
<console>
id   seq_color
--   ---------
 1   blue
 2   red
 3   green
 4   cyan
 5   magenta
 6   yellow
 7   black
 8   blue
 9   red
10   green
</console>
</unit>

Because a [[docs:resource:generator|generator]] is just a [[docs:resource:resource|data resource]], you can use it in every [[docs:op:op|data operation]].
