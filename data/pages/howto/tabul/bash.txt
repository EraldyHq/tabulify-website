====== How to install and configure Bash On Windows ? ======



===== About =====
This section helps you to get a ''bash'' based terminal up and running on your Windows computer.  On linux system, there is no installation needed because bash is the default shell (located at ''/bin/bash/'')

<note>
Tabulify recommends the use of bash as shell because it will not interpret an [[docs:connection:uri|URL]]

If you want to no more about it, see this page: [[docs:common:bash]]
</note>

===== Steps =====
==== Installation ====
On Windows, luckily, if you have [[https://gitforwindows.org/|Git For Windows]], you have already ''Git Bash'' (ie [[http://mingw-w64.org/|MingWin]]). Otherwise, we invite you to [[https://gitforwindows.org/|download and install it]].

==== Terminal Width Size ====

Set the width size of you terminal to a big enough number. We recommend 9000.

When [[docs:tabul:env:list|listing some configuration]], you may get a lengthy output (such as a list of a path) and the output will then not render nicely.

To avoid this inconvenient, our advice is to increase the width size of your terminal.

Example with ''Git Bash'':
  * Top-Left corner > Options > Window
