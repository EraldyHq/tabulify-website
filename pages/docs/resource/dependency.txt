====== Data Resource - Dependency ======


===== About =====
A '' resource  dependency'' (known also as ''dependency  link'') defines a dependency relationship between two [[resource|resources]].

The most known dependency is the [[fkey|foreign key dependencies]] but a [[view|view]] is also dependent on all [[table|tables]] present in its [[select|query]].



<note tip>
  * The [[docs:tabli:flag|tabli flag]] ''%%--with-dependencies%%'' permits to add the dependencies to your selection in most of the [[docs:tabli:tabli|tabli]] command. If the flag is not present and that the [[docs:flow:target|target resources]] must be created, the [[fkey|foreign key]] will not be copied.
  * The [[docs:tabli:data:dep|data dep command]] lists the dependencies.
