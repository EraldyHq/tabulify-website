====== Tabli - Data Copy Command ======


===== About =====
''data copy'' is a [[docs:tabli:command|command]] that supports the [[docs:op:copy|copy operation]].

<note>
It's just an alias of the [[transfer|transfer command]] where the [[docs:op:transfer#operation|transfer operation]] has the value ''copy''.
</note>



===== Prerequisites =====
A [[docs:op:copy|copy]] operation creates a [[docs:flow:target|target data resource]] that is a ''copy'' of the [[docs:flow:source|source data resource]] meaning that
 they should have the same:
  * [[docs:resource:structure|structure]]
  * [[docs:resource:count|number of rows]]

Therefore if the [[docs:flow:target|target data resource]] exists:
  * the [[docs:flow:target|target data resource]] should have the same [[docs:resource:structure|structure]] than the [[docs:flow:source|source data resource]]
  * or you set the ''target-operation'' to ''replace''
  * the [[docs:flow:target|target data resource]] should be empty
  * or you set the ''target-operation'' to ''truncate''
===== Syntax =====

Tabli data copy
===============

Copy one or more data resources.

Note: This is an alias command to the `transfer` command with the `copy` transfer operation.



Examples
--------

 1 - To copy the table `time` from the data store `sqlite` into the file `time.csv`, you would execute


        tabli data copy time@sqlite time.csv


 2 - To copy the file `foo.txt` to the file `foo_copy.txt`, you would execute


        tabli data copy foo.txt foo_copy.txt




Syntax
------


    tabli data copy [options|flags] <source-selector> <target-data-uri>


where:


  Arguments:

    <source-selector>                                       A data selector that select the data resources to transfer

    <target-data-uri>                                       A target data URI that defines the destination (Example: [table]@connection). If the target data uri has no name, the name will be the name of the source.


  Cross Data Transfer Options:

    -bs,--buffer-size <bufferSize>                          defines the size of the memory buffer between the source and target threads

    -mdu,--metrics-data-uri <metricsDataUri>                defines a target data uri where the data metrics should be exported

    -sfs,--source-fetch-size <fetchSize>                    defines the fetch size against the source connection

    -tbs,--target-batch-size <batchSize>                    defines the batch size against the target data resource

    -tcf,--target-commit-frequency <commitFrequency>        defines the commit frequency in number of batches against the target data resource

    -tw,--target-worker <targetWorkerCount>                 defines the target number of thread against the target connection

    -wbv,--with-bind-variables                              defines if bind variables are used in the SQL statement


  Data Definition Options:

    -sa,--source-attribute <attributeName=value>            Set a source data resource attribute

    -ta,--target-attribute <attributeName=value>            Set a target data resource attribute


  Transfer Operation Options:

    -so,--source-operation <value>                          defines the data operation (drop or truncate) on the source after transfer. Note: A `move` operation will drop the source.

    -to,--target-operation <targetDataOperation>            defines the data operations (replace, truncate) on the existing target before transfer.


  Selection Options:

    -wd,--with-dependencies                                 If set, the dependencies will be also selected


  Global Options:

    -cf,--conf <path>                                       The path to a configuration file

    -cv,--connection-vault <path>                           The path where the connection vault is located

    -h,--help                                               Print this help

    -l,--log-level <error|warning|tip|info|fine>            Set the log level

    -ns,--not-strict                                        A minor error will not stop the process.

    -odu,--output-data-uri <outputDataUri>                  defines the output data uri for the feedback data (default: console)

    -oo,--output-operation <dataOperation>                  defines the data operations (replace, truncate) on an existing output resource before transfer.

    -oop,--output-transfer-operation <transferOperation>    defines the output transfer operation (insert, update, merge, copy). Default to `copy` for a file system and `insert` for a database.

    -pp,--passphrase <passphrase>                           A passphrase (master password) to decrypt the encrypted values
</console>
