====== Sqlite - Boolean ======


===== Boolean =====
[[sqlite|Sqlite]] does not support natively the ''BOOLEAN'' data type. 

It recommends to save it as an integer ''0'' (false) and ''1'' (true). 
See [[https://sqlite.org/datatype3.html#boolean_datatype|Sqlite boolean documentation]]

<note>
''Tabulify'' supports it and extends the boolean system. It recognize also natively a list of string and number as ''BOOLEAN'' (case indépendant: ''Y'' or ''y'' means ''y''). More [[docs:common:boolean]]
